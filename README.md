# I2C_Communication
Multi Arduino Knight rider light with 12 LEDs and a Potentiometer.
12 LEDS are arranged in a row. The LEDs are numbered as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... and 12.Then these LEDs are connected to an Arduino UNO board.
A second Arduino UNO board is taken and connected to a potentiometer. 
Basically connecting 12 LEDs to First Arduino and a potentiometer to the second Arduino.
Rotating the potentiometer clockwise in the first Arduino should increase the speed of LEDchasing in the second Arduino and rotating the 
potentiometer anti-clockwise should decreasethe speed of LED chasing. 
The minimum chasing speed is 1 second and the maximum speed is 1 millisecond.
